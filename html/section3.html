Notes on Implementation

Articles Grid: The articles section uses a responsive grid layout with 3 items per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, and 1 on mobile.
Article Cards: Each card follows a consistent structure with:

An image area with a decorative geometric shape (currently a placeholder)
A title that clearly indicates the article subject
A brief excerpt that summarizes the content
A publication date for recency information
A "Read More" button that would link to the full article


Visual Style: The design maintains the Bauhaus-inspired aesthetic consistent with the rest of the site, using geometric shapes and a clean layout.
Call to Action: A centered "View All Articles" button provides access to the complete article archive.
Animation Hook: A highlight-row element is included at the end of the section for the animation system to use as a reference point.
Semantic Structure: The HTML uses semantic markup with appropriate heading levels to maintain accessibility and SEO best practices.
Responsive Considerations: The structure accounts for different screen sizes, with the grid layout adapting based on the viewport width.
Future Expansion: This structure can easily accommodate additional articles by adding more article-card elements to the grid.
